You just made the worst mistake
And you'll regret it, darling
'Cause once you give and then you take
You'll only end up wanting
was everything hard enough?
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) 'cause one day you'll wake up
And then you'll say
"I wanna be your lover
I don't wanna be your friend"
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone, my dear
So tell me that you love me again (tell me that you love me again)
